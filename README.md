This is a copy of a wonderful FASTA parser from the following BioStars thread:

[https://www.biostars.org/p/42126/](https://www.biostars.org/p/42126/)

Pierre, if you're out there, I'd love to make this public and add more
parsers (.fastq, sam, etc.). Please let me know if you would like to
open source license this!
